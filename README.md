# Hi, I'm Jill Aurelie 👋

I am an Application Developer Student  
Focusing on Android development with Kotlin & Jetpack Compose - also learning Flutter, React Native, and Swift.

## I’m currently working on...  
- Improving architecture patterns
- To Build Scalable Systems
  - MVVM
- Navigation 3
- Jetpack Compose
- Viewmodel Injection
  - Hilt, Koin
- Exploring cross-platform frameworks
- REST APIs
- Modern Android Development

### Tech Stack
- Kotlin
- Java
- Jetpack Compose
- Android Studio
- Git & GitHub
- Trello
- Figma
- Lucid: UML-Diagram

### Backend & API Experience

I have experience building frontend applications that consume backend services using Firebase.

- Integrated Firebase Firestore and Authentication as backend services  
- Consumed backend data via APIs using Firebase SDK  
- Transformed technical data structures into clear, user-friendly UI  
- Implemented loading states, error handling, and responsive UX  

This experience is equivalent to working with REST APIs and backend integration in modern app development.

### Goals
- Build useful mobile apps
- Improve UI/UX
- Finding a resourceful LIA where I can develop my skills further with experienced developers and likeminded people.
