# Hi, I'm Aurelie 👋

I am an Application Developer Student  
Focusing on Android development with Kotlin & Jetpack Compose - also learning Flutter, React, and Swift.

## I’m currently working on...  
- **War Card Game App** (my first Android project during my studies, now being further developed using newly acquired skills)  
  👉 Repo: https://github.com/aurevau/warCardGameCompose

- **Goal Tracking App**  
Built with Navigation3, Jetpack Compose, MVVM, StateFlow & Coroutines  
  👉 Repo: https://github.com/aurevau/task

- Improving architecture patterns
- Exploring cross-platform frameworks

### Tech Stack
- Kotlin
- Java
- Jetpack Compose
- Android Studio
- Koin
- Git & GitHub
- Trello
- Figma
- Lucid: UML-Diagram

## Backend & API Experience

I have experience building frontend applications that consume backend services using Firebase.

- Integrated Firebase Firestore and Authentication as backend services  
- Consumed backend data via APIs using Firebase SDK  
- Transformed technical data structures into clear, user-friendly UI  
- Implemented loading states, error handling, and responsive UX  

This experience is equivalent to working with REST APIs and backend integration in modern app development.

### Currently Learning
- Clean Architecture
- To Build Scalable Systems
- MVVM
- REST APIs
- Hilt
- Modern Android Development

### Goals
- Build useful mobile apps
- Improve UI/UX
- Collaborate on open-source projects
